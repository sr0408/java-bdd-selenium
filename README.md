# BDD Framework for Selenium with Java

This repository contains a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework for automating web applications using Selenium WebDriver and Java. The framework is designed to support easy-to-read test scenarios written in Gherkin syntax and executed using Cucumber. It integrates with popular tools like Maven for build management and TestNG for test execution.

## Features:
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For automating browser interactions and testing user interfaces.
- **Cucumber**: A BDD tool that uses Gherkin syntax for writing readable and understandable test scenarios.
- **JUnit/TestNG**: For test execution and reporting.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and building the project.
- **Page Object Model**: Implements the Page Object design pattern for better maintainability of the test scripts.
- **Parallel Test Execution**: Supports parallel execution for faster test runs with integration to tools like TestNG or Maven Surefire Plugin.
- **Custom Reporting**: Generates detailed and customizable test reports for better test analysis and debugging.
